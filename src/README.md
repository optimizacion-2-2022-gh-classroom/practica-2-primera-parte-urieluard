# MaxFlowAeiu

**This package executes the Ford-Fulkerson method to find the maximum flow of a network.**

What is proposed with the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is to search for paths in which the flow can be increased, until the maximum flow or the path with the maximum capacity of the arches is reached. The creators of this algorithm are: L. R. Ford, Jr. and D. R. Fulkerson. The idea is to find a penetration path with a net positive flux linking the source and destination nodes.
